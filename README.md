🐍 Python Learning Journey
Welcome to my Python Learning Repository — a collection of weekly exercises that document my progress in mastering Python programming step by step. Each week focuses on a new set of programming concepts, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

📅 Weekly Overview
Week 1: Core Python Foundations

-Key Concepts: Variables, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, functions, lists

Week 2: Control Flow & Built-in Functions

-Key Concepts: Loops, zip(), enumerate(), range(), conditionals, random module

Week 3: Functional Programming & Error Handling

-Key Concepts: Generators, lambda, map, filter, reduce, recursion, try-except

Week 4: Advanced OOP Applications

*Key Concepts: Classes, inheritance, dunder methods, file operations, composition, system-based structures

🧠 Learning Goals
Throughout this journey, I aim to:

-Build a strong foundation in Python syntax and logic

-Strengthen my algorithmic and analytical thinking

-Learn how to structure and modularize code effectively

-Develop real-world style mini-projects to apply what I learn

-Prepare for more advanced topics like OOP, APIs, and data analysis
