🐍 Python Learning Journey
Welcome to my Python Learning Repository — a collection of weekly exercises that document my progress in mastering Python programming step by step. Each week focuses on a new set of programming concepts, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

📅 Weekly Overview
Week 1: Core Python Foundations

-Key Concepts: Variables, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, functions, lists

Week 2: Control Flow & Built-in Functions

-Key Concepts: Loops, zip(), enumerate(), range(), conditionals, random module

Week 3: Functional Programming & Error Handling

-Key Concepts: Generators, lambda, map, filter, reduce, recursion, try-except

🧠 Learning Goals
Throughout this journey, I aim to:

-Build a strong foundation in Python syntax and logic

-Strengthen my algorithmic and analytical thinking

-Learn how to structure and modularize code effectively

-Develop real-world style mini-projects to apply what I learn

-Prepare for more advanced topics like OOP, APIs, and data analysis

🧩 Weekly Folders
📁 Week 1 — Python Practice Tasks

→ Focus on fundamental programming skills: conditionals, loops, data handling, and basic system logic.

📁 Week 2 — Python Practice Tasks

→ Focus on deeper loop usage, control flow, and Python’s built-in functions.

📁 Week 3 — Python Practice Tasks

→ Focus on functional programming (lambda, map), generators, recursion, and error handling.

(Each folder includes a README.md describing the exercises, goals, and how to run them.) 


▶️ How to Run
-Navigate to the folder of the week you want to explore.

-Open the Python file for any task.

-Run it in your preferred environment (VS Code, PyCharm, or terminal).

-Each task is stand-alone and can be executed independently.
