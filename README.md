🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository — a collection of weekly exercises that document my progress in mastering Python programming step by step.

Each week focuses on a new set of programming concepts, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more complex logic and problem-solving techniques.

📅 Weekly Overview
Week	Focus Area	Key Concepts Practiced
Week 1	Core Python Foundations	Variables, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, functions, lists
Week 2	Control Flow & Built-in Functions	Loops, zip(), enumerate(), range(), conditionals, random module
🧠 Learning Goals

1-Throughout this journey, I aim to:

2-Build a strong foundation in Python syntax and logic

3-Strengthen my algorithmic and analytical thinking

4-Learn how to structure and modularize code effectively

5-Develop real-world style mini-projects to apply what I learn

6-Prepare for more advanced topics like OOP, APIs, and data analysis

🧩 Weekly Folders

📁 Week 1 — Python Practice Tasks
→ Focus on fundamental programming skills: conditionals, loops, data handling, and basic system logic.

📁 Week 2 — Python Practice Tasks
→ Focus on deeper loop usage, control flow, and Python’s built-in functions.

Each folder includes a README.md describing the exercises, goals, and how to run them.

▶️ How to Run

1-Navigate to the folder of the week you want to explore.

2-Open the Python file for any task.

3-Run it in your preferred environment (VS Code, PyCharm, or terminal).

Each task is stand-alone and can be executed independently.
