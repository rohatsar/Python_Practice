Week 2 — Python Practice Tasks

This folder contains my Python exercises for Week 2, focusing on building a deeper understanding of loops, conditionals, and data handling.
Each task is designed to enhance my problem-solving abilities and reinforce key Python programming concepts. 🧠🐍

🗂️ Tasks Overview

Squares of Numbers

Create a list containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10

Demonstrates the use of loops and arithmetic operations

Multiplication Table

Generate a multiplication table (1 to 10) using nested loops

Format the output neatly for clear readability

Number Guessing Game

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100

The user has 10 attempts to guess it, receiving hints if the guess is too high or too low

Demonstrates conditionals, loops, and usage of the random module

Sum of Odd Numbers

Ask the user to enter 10 numbers and calculate the sum of only the odd ones

Provides live feedback when a number is added

Shows practical use of the continue statement and loop control

Zip Function with Index

Combine two lists (names and ages) using the zip() function

Display the index, name, and age in a clear format

Demonstrates zip() and enumerate() together

Range Function Practice

(a) Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100

(b) Print numbers from 50 down to 40

Demonstrates range() with both positive and negative step values

🎯 Goals & Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, I aim to:

Strengthen my understanding of loops and iteration techniques

Apply conditional logic effectively in real-world style problems

Explore Python’s built-in functions like zip(), enumerate(), and range()

Improve code clarity, readability, and formatting skills

Build confidence in writing interactive console-based programs

▶️ How to Run

Each task is stand-alone and independent.
Simply open the corresponding Python file and run it in your preferred environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or terminal).
