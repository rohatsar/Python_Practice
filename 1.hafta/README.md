Week 1 ‚Äî Python Practice Tasks

This repository documents my step-by-step Python learning journey.
Each exercise focuses on a specific programming concept and helps strengthen my problem-solving, logic, and code structuring skills. üß©

üóÇÔ∏è Tasks Overview

Student Grade Tracking System

Store and manage student data using dictionaries and lists

Calculate average grades and determine pass/fail status

Word Frequency Analyzer

Count how often each word appears in a given text

Remove punctuation and handle case sensitivity

Identify the most frequently used words

User Registration and Login System

Validate username, password, email, and age inputs

Return True if all validation rules are met, otherwise False

Basic Calculator

Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Track hours requiring air conditioning or heating

Compute maximum, minimum, difference, and daily average temperature

üéØ Goals & Learning Outcomes

By completing these tasks, I aim to:

Strengthen my Python fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, data structures)

Improve my analytical and algorithmic thinking

Learn how to structure small-scale programs clearly and efficiently

Gain confidence in debugging and testing simple Python scripts

Prepare for more advanced topics such as OOP, data analysis, and API handling

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Each task is independent and self-contained.
Simply open the Python file for the specific task and run it in your preferred environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or terminal).
